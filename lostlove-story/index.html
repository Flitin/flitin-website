                                    Once upon a time, there was a man who was deeply in love with a woman. 
                                    She was a beautiful woman, mid height, a little chubby, big eyes and a gorgeous smile, 
                                    but not only that, she was one of those very rare type o woman that could make you laugh effortless, 
                                    but only if she trust you, and were close enough of you, out of that, she was very shy and had no confidence.<br><br>

                                    The man was a kinda tall, little skinny and funny, but he was too slow when comes about relationship, didn't had much experience in it.
                                    He had only a few close friends, but they didn't talk too much, they were cyber friends by the way.
                                    The man was a family guy, he had one young sibling that he used to take to school sometimes.<br><br>

                                    Those beings bound to fall in love were both young, and in certain way lonely.
                                    For more they use to live with their parents, there is a different type of lonelyness 
                                    when you don't have real and loyal friends that you can count on, or even a person that you can love, trust and understand, 
                                    where in their arms you can feel safe and cozy regardless the place you are.<br><br>

                                    The woman didn't had a job at the time, so she barely leave the house, except for take out the trash or open the door for a pizza delivery.
                                    One day, in one of those delivery, she opened the door and there was him, he worked for a pizza store, i know that is a cliche, but he had two jobs, 
                                    the other one where in his father car wash company.
                                    She liked him at first sight, her eyes shined but she didn't hold eye contact for too long, while him tought she as strange for that sudden head turn, 
                                    the sight she gave him was more than a hint, but he didn't got it.<br><br>

                                    The next day she kind sufered for not tell him what she felt, and she realized that he frowned in a funny way.
                                    She was so embarrassed but the same time so in love, a mix of feelings and anxiety, the guy however continued living normally, 
                                    in his head he didn't had any chance with her so he kinda ignored the situation and also at the time the only thing he was focused on was making money, 
                                    to have a decent life at the age of 30. Cruel, isn't? Study for 10 or more years, work hard in a 9 to 5 for more 10, and start to living at 30 
                                    and still working hard till you get old and die, I think we're living wrong.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Passed a week and she still with him in her mind, working up the courage to ask him on a date or something, that night she decided that she would order a pizza delivery to ask him out.
                                    About 8:00pm she ordered a pizza and didn't took to long to come. Around 8:23pm... knock knock, she was close to the door, her soul left her body at the moment, 
                                    she was about to ask out a strange that she olny saw once, and not only that, would be her first time asking someone out.
                                    Battling a monstrous amount of anxiety, she opened the door with her trembling and sweaty hands and before she say anything she hear her dog barking a lot 
                                    and trying to bite the poor guy, she jumped out of her house, saying sorry several times, she grabed the pizza and the dog and entered the house, seconds later she come back
                                    extremely embarrassed to pay the guy, and she realize that the guy wasn't the man she fell in love with and at the end of this whole mess she felt a relief.<br><br>
